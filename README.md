# Time-Management
Time is Allocation
Time is Energy
Time is Money

If you are earning 26000 in month that means 
hourly you are earning 130 Rs 
so if you are watching netflix or some movie scrolling insta,fb 
for 2-3 hours actually 130*3 = 390 rs daily and monthly 11700 Rs 
are you spending on this things so simply think before doing this.

if you are not earning anything r8 now then think of that
what is your value in this world?
what you think of yourself?


Repeat this to you

something is anything i.e cooking playing watching movie scrolling insta fb etc etc etc

"Something is not My Priority"
